Warranty Details 02 years International Limited Warranty","ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702 Core i7 12th Gen 16GB RAM 1TB SSD 17.3"" Touch Display Foled Laptop
The ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED is a revolutionary spin on the conventional laptop, having a 17.3"" foldable screen. This laptop sports a Foldable OLED display with a 4:3 aspect ratio and a 2560 x 1920 resolution. The Fold can be utilized in a variety of flexible ways thanks to its 17.3"" display when completely opened and 12.5"" each side when folded. The 12th Gen Intel Core i7-1250U 1.1 GHz (12M Cache, up to 4.7 GHz, 2P+8E cores) and 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM power the ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702. It offers the performance you require thanks to a 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe Performance SSD. It features Intel Iris Xe Graphics incorporated inside it.
World's First 17-inch Foldable OLED Laptop
The ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702 has a revolutionary Foldable OLED touchscreen with a resolution of 2560 x 1920. The 4:3 OLED screen has all of the advantages, including a 0.2 ms response time, a refresh rate of 60 Hz, 1.07 billion colors, PANTONE Validation for realistic colors, and an ultra-vivid 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. Dolby Vision is supported by the VESA Certified DisplayHDR True Black 500 display for vivid HDR graphics. The screen also has TÜV Rheinland eye-care certification and has 70% lower blue light levels than a standard LCD panel. When folded, the display has a 12.5-inch diagonal display. Each side has a screen with a 1920 x 1280 resolution and a 3:2 aspect ratio. Because of the ZenBook Fold's innovative foldable hinge and OLED screen, this comes in handy while using it in different modes. In some configurations, one of the 12.5"" screens can display a virtual onscreen keyboard, allowing you to use the ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED as a one-of-a-kind two-screen laptop.

Premium Design and High-tech Materials
Zenbook 17 Fold OLED redefines the idea of premium, from its distinctive color and high-tech materials to its breathtakingly exquisite finish. You'll never have to settle for less in a laptop because it has everything you need. When unfolded, the ultra-compact chassis is only 8.7 mm thick, made of magnesium alloy, and finished in Tech Black with an integrated dark green faux-leather ergonomic kickstand. The new ASUS monogram on dark blue glass catches the light in an intriguing way as you spin the laptop around.

A new hybrid of Laptop and Tablet
The ZenBook 17 Fold OLED's foldable OLED panel allows it to surpass the limits of a standard laptop. It can be used in Laptop Mode, Desktop Mode, Tablet Mode, E-Book Reader Mode, or Extended Mode. When fully unfolded in Tablet mode, the Fold provides full access to the 17.3"" display, which includes intuitive touch controls. You can fold the screen slightly into Book mode for a more pleasant reading experience. You can use ScreenXpert features to display different content and apps on either side of the folded screen. The ZenBook 17 Fold OLED can be propped up in Desktop Mode thanks to the built-in leather kickstand. You can utilize the wireless ASUS ErogSense Bluetooth Keyboard. The ZenBook Fold retains some of its laptop heritage. When you fold the screen into a clamshell form, the keyboard magnetically snaps into place, giving you the sensation of a traditional clamshell laptop. You can also use an on-screen virtual keyboard instead of the keyboard if you want to.

Effortless Performance
The ZenBook 17 Fold OLED is powered by a 12-core Intel Core i7-1250U processor and 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. Its performance cores may be overclocked to 4.7 GHz, while the efficiency cores do background operations. The graphics are handled by integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics. The ZenBook Fold has a 1TB M.2 NVMe PCIe 4.0 performance SSD for storage. The SSD delivers speedy boot and load speeds, letting you turn on the Fold and get into your apps immediately. Wi-Fi 6E uses the less congested 6 GHz band with compatible networks to deliver smooth video streaming and online gaming experiences.

Harman Kardon quad-speaker with Dolby Atmos
The powerful Harman Kardon-certified quad-speaker Dolby Atmos audio system on the ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702 provides immersive surround sound. It's powered by a clever amplifier that enhances volume while eliminating distortion, resulting in crystal-clear sound for entertainment or conversations. The dual-channel smart amplifier's volume-boosting, distortion-reducing DSP chip allows it to drive the twin speakers at maximum volume while preventing long-term harm to the sensitive speaker voice coils.
Next-level AI noise-canceling audio technology
ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED is equipped with ASUS AI noise-canceling technology to ensure the finest experience as remote work and video conferences increased. ASUS AI noise-canceling audio makes use of machine learning to separate undesirable noise from human speech. The MyASUS app's ClearVoice Mic feature can filter out ambient noise and normalize all individual voices in Multi-presenter mode from various positions for optimal group conference-call quality. The ClearVoice Speaker function eliminates all ambient noise except human speech, allowing you to hear what everyone else is saying.
ASUS ErgoSense Bluetooth Keyboard & Touchpad
The wireless ASUS ErgoSense Bluetooth Keyboard is included with the ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702. The keyboard's 19.05mm key pitch, 1.4mm key travel, and 0.2mm keycap dish give a comfortable yet precise typing experience. The keyboard connects wirelessly to the Fold through Bluetooth, allowing you to use it separately. When in Laptop mode, it magnetically links to the Fold, which immediately converts to a 12.5"" screen for a typical clamshell laptop layout. The touchpad's smooth glide is intended to be soft.

Innovative Camera System
The ASUS ZenBook 17 Fold OLED UX9702's webcam makes it easy to participate in video calls, improving collaboration and productivity. You can have crystal-clear video calls with the ASUS 3D Noise Reduction (3DNR) technology on the 5MP AI webcam. To ensure that everything appears clear and crisp during video calls, the innovative technology does real-time de-noising and image sharpening. Additionally, the screen's brightness and color temperature are automatically adjusted by a color sensor in response to ambient light levels to deliver the best possible image. The Intel Visual Sensing Controller provides power to the HD infrared camera with AdaptiveLock. This artificial intelligence (AI)-powered technology detects when you step away from the laptop, locks it for security, and automatically logs you back in as soon as you are close to it. It also dims the screen when you glance away from it to conserve battery life.
Ports and Connectivity
The USB Type-C ports of the Zenbook 17 Fold OLED support the most recent Thunderbolt 4 technology, as well as Power Delivery and DisplayPort. Thunderbolt 4 interface uses the reversible USB Type-C connector and has a maximum speed of 40 Gb/s when utilized with compatible devices. The port also transmits data through USB4 at up to 20 Gb/s, and the dual-bandwidth DisplayPort allows you to connect a single 8K monitor or up to two 4K monitors at the same time. Furthermore, you may daisy link up to six devices from a single Thunderbolt 4 connector. A 3.5mm combo connector for headphones or an external microphone is provided for audio. The ZenBook 17 Fold OLED also has a power button and volume buttons on the sides.
Ultra-demanding MIL-STD 810H military standard
The Zenbook 17 Fold OLED satisfies the ultra-demanding MIL-STD 810H military standard for dependability and endurance, having gone through a grueling test regime that included extended tests for operation in hostile situations such as extreme altitudes, temperatures, and humidity. It also passes ASUS laptop tests that are considerably beyond industry standards. The revolutionary precision-engineered hinge is tested to at least 30,000-cycle torture test to ensure maximum longevity.
